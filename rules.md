# Skills

# Advantages / Disadvantages

# Mechanics
## Currency

For simplicity use existing prices from SLA book, in regards to purchasing equipment, etc. Starting wealth and advantages/disadvantages that affect it are unchanged from SLA as well, i.e. follow it RAW.

## Skill Rolls / Resolution

Target Number (TN) = stat + skill ranks +- bonus/penalties.
Roll 3d6 <= TN = Success.  

## Hit Points/Health/Healing

Hit Points are figured as per SLA main. Hit Locations and all.

Ebon healing and drug healing both take 1 full round.

Stormers may heal one wound at start of their turn. When they have no wounds, they may heal 1 hit point at that start of their turn.

## Fear

Fear checks should be performed as a COOL stat check, with an appropriate penalty (+3 to -5). On a fail, use the margin of failure and consult the chart below:
