# SLA-GURPS

A SLA Industries and GURPS mashup. The intention is to keep the SLA theme (factions, races, classes, stats, skills, adv/dis, and equipment) but use GURPS style mechanics (3d6 roll under, single second turns, speed based initiative). Primarily this simplifies the SLA combats and takes advantage of that sweet 3d6 bell curve. 

## Getting Started

Firstly, this is not a comprehensive conversion or compendium. Knowledge of both systems is probably necessary as we will not be able to post system details, in the interest of avoiding IP infringement. 

### Prerequisites

* SLA Industries Rulebook
* Gurps Basic Set

All files are written in markdown and can be rendered in your renderer of choice, but, could also be printed as raw text, since markdown avoids opinioning the text.

The simplest method to pull the files locally, would be to clone the repo down.
1. Open your favored terminal.
2. Create or navigate to your desired destination folder.
3. Enter the command below.

```
git clone git@github.com:aarongaither/SLA-GURPS.git
```
